# MOCCA

(from https://www.egiz.gv.at/en/schwerpunkte/9-MOCCA)

Modular Open Citizen Card Architecture is a project started by EGIZ for the implementation of a free, modular, open-source Citizen Card Environment (CCE). Currently two different implementations of a citizen card environment are provided  in Java: MOCCA Online and MOCCA Local (BKULocal) is the "classic" implementation of a citizen card environment to be installed.

As the support for MOCCA is discontinued since end of 2017 (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/support-mocca-online-will) this repository maintains a copy of the source code.

The original repository is http://git.egiz.gv.at/mocca/.
